# CropPrediction
This is the first ML project i had taken up in August,2017. It was me entering the ML world
One of the keys issues faced by farmers in India is the choice of crops. We basically built various ML models that predict the best crop to grow under different conditions.
The dataset consists of 13 most common crops in India. We considered 4 main environmental factors:
1) pH
2) Rainfall(in mm)
3) Relative Humidity
4) Temperature
Also we built a UI using PyQT, where in a farmer can enter the above mentioned environmental conditions and can select one of the give 4 models:
1) KNN
2) Random Forest
3) Naive Bayes
4) ANN
